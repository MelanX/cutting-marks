# CuttingMarks
CuttingMarks makes editing lets plays much easier.

If you wanna use it with your own hotkeys you have to change in [main.py](https://www.github.com/MelanX/cutting-marks/main.py).
The output file is optimized for importing in Sony Vegas Pro 14.0. To automate this I'm using [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). The AHK file is hard-coded for FullHD. To import the markers you have to press Ctrl + Q.
